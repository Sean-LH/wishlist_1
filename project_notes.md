What was done:
  - Part of the form has been built
    - the form can receive names and the names do pop up on a list upon being submitted
  - 
Current Step:
- Creating functions that can delete the items
  -- Writing a filter function that singles out the clicked item and returns the altered list.
  -- It will be an "onClick" function attached to the delete buttons
  -- The delete function may need to be passed down to the component.

On the Back End:
  --  1 Server has been built and is connected to the Database
  -- Routes have been built for the page hosting the list of names and a Route has been built for the page holding list of items. 
  -- Schemas have been built for both end points.


-- The relationship between my databases must be on a "one to many" relationship.
--- Give the ID of the one to the many

Front End: 
- Build function delete button for the 'Names" list
